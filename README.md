# TWITTER-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-NLP-
Twitter Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data to classify tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models to analyze the sentiment of tweets fetched via Twitter API or a dataset.

This project helped me explore:

Preprocessing text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)

Feature extraction (TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words)

Building and evaluating machine learning models

Visualizing sentiment distribution

Features
Preprocesses raw tweets (removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, emojis, and special characters)

Sentiment classification using ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Random Forest)

Data visualization (word clouds, sentiment distribution graphs)

Supports custom datasets (CSV format with tweets)

Easy-to-use Python scripts

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Libraries/Tools:

pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud

scikit-learn

NLTK or spaCy

tweepy (for fetching live tweets - optional)

Dataset
You can use any open-source dataset like:

Sentiment140 Dataset

Kaggle datasets: Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140

Alternatively, you can scrape live tweets using the Twitter API and tweepy.
